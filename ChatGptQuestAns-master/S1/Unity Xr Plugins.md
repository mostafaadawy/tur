# what is unity xr plugins?

Unity XR Plugins are a set of Unity engine components that provide support for building virtual and augmented reality applications. They enable developers to easily create applications that can run on a wide range of virtual and augmented reality devices, including head-mounted displays, mobile devices, and more.

Unity XR Plugins provide a common interface for working with different virtual and augmented reality platforms, such as Oculus, HTC Vive, Windows Mixed Reality, Google Cardboard, and more. This allows developers to write code once and have it work across multiple devices and platforms, without needing to rewrite their code for each individual platform.

Unity XR Plugins include the following key components:

    XR SDK: A set of APIs and tools that enable developers to create immersive experiences for a wide range of VR and AR platforms.

    XR Interaction Toolkit: A set of UI components and tools that make it easy to create interactive VR and AR experiences, including teleportation, object grabbing, and more.

    XR Input System: A unified input system that supports a wide range of input devices, such as hand controllers, gaze-based input, and more.

    XR Management: A set of tools and APIs for configuring and managing VR and AR devices, including device detection, device tracking, and more.

Unity XR Plugins simplify the process of building VR and AR applications, enabling developers to focus on creating immersive and engaging experiences without needing to worry about the underlying hardware and platform-specific details.
