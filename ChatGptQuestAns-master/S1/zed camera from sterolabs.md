# how to begin developing on zed camera from sterolabs?
Developing with the ZED Camera from Stereolabs can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some steps to get started:

    Install the ZED SDK: Download the ZED SDK from the Stereolabs website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

    Set up your development environment: Stereolabs provides an API for accessing the ZED camera using a variety of programming languages, including C++, Python, and Unity. Choose the language and development environment you are most comfortable with and set it up to use the ZED SDK.

    Connect your ZED camera: Connect your ZED camera to your computer using the USB cable provided. Make sure the camera is powered on and recognized by your computer.

    Run the sample code: Stereolabs provides sample code to get you started with using the ZED camera. Compile and run the sample code to make sure everything is working correctly.

    Experiment with the settings: The ZED camera provides a variety of settings that can be adjusted to improve the quality of your captures. Experiment with the settings to see how they affect your images.

    Start your own project: Once you are comfortable with the ZED camera and the SDK, start your own project. Think about what you want to capture and how you can use the depth information provided by the ZED camera to create something unique.

    Join the community: Stereolabs provides a community forum where you can ask questions, share your projects, and get feedback from other ZED camera developers. Join the community to learn from others and improve your skills.

Remember, developing with the ZED camera is a fun and challenging experience. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. Good luck!
# how to make script to prevent other devices from connecting to my zed camera except me?
To prevent other devices from connecting to your ZED camera except you, you can write a script that utilizes the ZED SDK API to implement authentication and connection restrictions. Here is an outline of how you could approach this task:

    Set up authentication: In order to restrict access to the ZED camera, you will need to set up authentication so that only authorized users can connect to the camera. You can create a username and password that you will use to authenticate yourself.

    Configure network settings: You will need to configure the network settings of your ZED camera to restrict access to only your device. You can set up a static IP address for your device, and configure the camera to only accept connections from that IP address.

    Implement connection restrictions: Using the ZED SDK API, you can implement connection restrictions to ensure that only authorized users can connect to the camera. You can create a script that checks the IP address of the device attempting to connect to the camera, and only allows the connection if the IP address matches your authorized device.

Here is an example of a Python script that implements these steps using the ZED SDK API:

## python
```sh
import pyzed.sl as sl

# Set up authentication
username = "myusername"
password = "mypassword"

# Configure network settings
ip_address = "192.168.1.100" # Replace with the static IP address of your device
net_params = sl.NetParams()
net_params.setInterfaceIpAddress(ip_address)

# Create ZED camera object
zed = sl.Camera()

# Connect to camera
init_params = sl.InitParameters()
init_params.camera_resolution = sl.RESOLUTION.HD720
init_params.camera_fps = 30
init_params.sdk_verbose = True
init_params.net_enable = True
init_params.net_params = net_params
err = zed.open(init_params)
if err != sl.ERROR_CODE.SUCCESS:
    print("Error opening ZED camera: ", sl.ERROR_CODE.tostring(err))
    exit()

# Implement connection restrictions
while True:
    connection = zed.get_connection()
    if connection.is_new_connection():
        remote_ip = connection.get_remote_ip_address()
        if remote_ip == ip_address:
            print("Authorized device connected!")
        else:
            print("Unauthorized device attempted to connect: ", remote_ip)
            connection.disconnect()

# Close camera
zed.close()

```
This script sets up authentication with a username and password, configures the network settings with a static IP address, and implements connection restrictions using a loop that checks the IP address of devices attempting to connect to the camera. The script only allows connections from the authorized device with the specified IP address.

Note that this is just an example script and should be customized to fit your specific needs and requirements.
