# how can i control raspberrypi gpios when pressed send data python?

To control Raspberry Pi GPIOs and send data using Python, you can use the RPi.GPIO library which allows you to easily control the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. Here is a basic example of how you can do this:

```sh
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Set up GPIO pin
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)

# Loop to monitor GPIO pin
while True:
    input_state = GPIO.input(18)
    if input_state == False:
        print('Button Pressed')
        # Code to send data here
        time.sleep(0.2)
```
In this example, we are monitoring GPIO pin 18 which is set up as an input with a pull-up resistor enabled. This means that when the button is pressed, the input pin will read a logic low. When this happens, the code will print "Button Pressed" and you can add the code to send data to this block.

You can replace the print() statement with your code to send data. For example, you could use a network protocol like MQTT to publish the data to a server or send it over the internet using the requests library.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example and you will need to customize it to fit your specific use case.

# how to make python file work automatically with raspberrypi start?

To make a Python file run automatically when Raspberry Pi starts up, you can use the following steps:

Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi and navigate to the folder where your Python file is located.

Type the following command to make your Python file executable:

```sh
chmod +x filename.py
```
Replace "filename.py" with the name of your Python file.

Open the rc.local file using the following command:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Add the following line to the end of the rc.local file, just before the exit 0 line:
```sh
python /path/to/your/filename.py &
```
Replace "/path/to/your/filename.py" with the actual path to your Python file.

The "&" symbol at the end of the line runs the command in the background so that the startup process isn't delayed.

Save the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, and then Enter.

Reboot your Raspberry Pi and your Python script should now run automatically.

Note that if you have any errors in your Python script, the startup process may fail. If this happens, you can check the rc.local file for any syntax errors by typing the following command:
```sh
sudo sh -c 'bash -n /etc/rc.local'
```
This will check the rc.local file for any syntax errors and return an error message if any are found.

Also, keep in mind that rc.local is run as the root user, so any commands in the script will be executed with root privileges. Make sure that your script doesn't do anything that requires non-root privileges unless it's absolutely necessary.

# rc.local doesnt run automatically it self 

If rc.local is not running automatically on startup, there might be a couple of reasons why this is happening:

Check that the rc.local file is enabled:
```sh
sudo systemctl status rc-local
```
If the output shows that rc-local.service is inactive, you can enable it using the following command:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable rc-local
```
Check that the rc.local file is executable:
```sh
ls -l /etc/rc.local
```
If the output shows that the rc.local file is not executable, you can make it executable using the following command:
```sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```
Check that the syntax in the rc.local file is correct:
```sh
sudo sh -c 'bash -n /etc/rc.local'
```
This command will check the syntax in the rc.local file and print any errors. Fix any syntax errors and save the file before trying to run it again.

Check that the Python script runs correctly:
```sh
sudo python /path/to/your/filename.py
```
    This command will run the Python script manually. Check that it runs correctly and exits without errors.

If none of these solutions work, you can try adding a delay to the rc.local file to give the system enough time to start up completely before running the script. You can do this by adding a sleep command to the rc.local file, like this:
```sh
/bin/sleep 10
```
This will add a 10-second delay before running the next command in rc.local. You can adjust the delay time as needed.

If you're still having trouble, you can try using systemd to run your Python script instead of rc.local. This will ensure that the script runs as a service and can be easily monitored and controlled.

# where to add this /bin/sleep 10

To add a delay to the rc.local file, you can add the sleep command before the command that runs your Python script. Here's an example of what the rc.local file might look like with the sleep command added:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
/bin/sleep 10
/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/filename.py &
exit 0
```
In this example, the sleep command will delay the execution of the next command by 10 seconds. After the delay, the command to run the Python script is executed with python3 and the & symbol runs the command in the background.

Make sure to replace "/path/to/your/filename.py" with the actual path to your Python file.

Once you have made the changes to the rc.local file, save it and reboot your Raspberry Pi. The delay should give the system enough time to fully boot up before running your Python script.

# sudo systemctl enable rc-local The unit files have no installation config (WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, Also=, Alias= settings in the [Install] ection, and DefaultInstance= for template units). This means they are not meant to be enabled using systemctl.

If you're seeing the error message "The unit files have no installation config" when trying to enable the rc-local service with systemctl, it could mean that the service file is missing or that it needs to be created.

Here's how you can create the rc-local service file:

    Open a new file in a text editor:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rc-local.service
```
Paste the following contents into the file:
```sh
[Unit]
Description=/etc/rc.local Compatibility
ConditionPathExists=/etc/rc.local

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/etc/rc.local start
TimeoutSec=0
StandardOutput=tty
RemainAfterExit=yes
SysVStartPriority=99

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save the file and close the editor.

Make the rc.local file executable:
```sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```
Reload the systemd daemon to load the new service file:
```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Enable the rc-local service:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service
```
Start the rc-local service:
```sh
sudo systemctl start rc-local.service
```
